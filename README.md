This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of error handling for invalid input. Specifically, the `/users/:id` route attempts to parse the `id` parameter as an integer without checking for potential errors. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as crashes or incorrect responses. The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, while `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version with proper error handling.
